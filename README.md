# Portfolio Project

This Django project is a demonstration of how a portfolio website may look. This project contains 2 django apps, Jobs and Blog.

The "Jobs" app is simply a collection of url routings though the main project/urls.py file to jobs/urls.py file which is routed to the respective HTML pages in the template folder of the app.

The second app "Blog" is a very basic and simple blog with the model structure as follows : 1. Title, 2. Publish date, 3. Image, 4. Body of the blogpost.

This simple blog structure makes it easy to convey your message to the world. Content is king. As this is a demonstration project, I kept the things very simple and did not go overboard to make it look like a replica of one of the most popular blogging sites like Medium.com

This complete Django package is also deployed on a VPS hosted by DigitalOcean. I will port it to AWS free tier shortly.

I have another project in my repos with a more complicated user structure, which is a clone of the one of the most popular sites online, Producthunt.com (Important Note: This project is only for educational purpose and is not for commercial use)
