# Portfolio Project

This Django project is a demonstration of how a portfolio website may look. This project contains 2 django apps, Jobs and Blog.

The "Jobs" app is simply a collection of url routings though the main project/urls.py file to jobs/urls.py file which is routed to the respective HTML pages in the template folder of the app.
